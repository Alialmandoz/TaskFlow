# Project Report: TaskFlow Application

## Introduction

This report details the development of an innovative task and expense management system. The primary purpose of this project is to provide users with a streamlined and intelligent solution for organizing their workload and tracking expenditures. A key feature of this system is its integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) capabilities, specifically for automating and assisting in the creation of tasks and projects. This AI-driven approach aims to enhance productivity, improve organization, and simplify the overall management of personal and professional responsibilities. The following sections will delve into the various aspects of the project, including its design, implementation, and features.

## Core Functionality

### Task Management (`tasks` app)

The `tasks` application is the cornerstone of the TaskFlow system, providing robust functionalities for managing projects and individual tasks. It allows users to organize their work effectively, track progress, and leverage AI for streamlined task creation.

#### Core Data Models

The task management system relies on two primary data models defined in `tasks/models.py`:

1.  **`Project`**: Represents a container for tasks, helping to group related activities.
    *   **Key Attributes**:
        *   `name` (CharField): The name of the project.
        *   `description` (TextField): An optional detailed description of the project.
        *   `user` (ForeignKey to `User`): Links the project to a specific user, ensuring data privacy and ownership.
        *   `created_at` (DateTimeField): Timestamp for when the project was created (auto-generated).
        *   `original_instruction` (TextField): Stores the original user instruction if the project was created via an AI command, providing context and transparency.

2.  **`Task`**: Represents an individual action item or to-do within a project.
    *   **Key Attributes**:
        *   `description` (TextField): A detailed description of the task.
        *   `status` (CharField): Tracks the current state of the task. It uses predefined choices: 'todo' (Por hacer), 'doing' (En progreso), and 'done' (Completada). The default status upon creation is 'todo'.
        *   `project` (ForeignKey to `Project`): Links the task to its parent project.
        *   `created_at` (DateTimeField): Timestamp for when the task was created (auto-generated).
        *   `due_date` (DateField): An optional date by which the task should be completed.
        *   `completed_at` (DateTimeField): Timestamp for when the task was marked as completed. This is updated by model methods.
        *   `original_instruction` (TextField): Stores the original user instruction if the task was created via an AI command.

User association is primarily managed at the `Project` level. Tasks are implicitly associated with the user who owns the parent project.

#### Project and Task Creation

The system supports both manual and AI-assisted creation of projects and tasks:

**1. Manual Creation:**

*   **Projects**: Users can create projects manually using a dedicated form (`ProjectForm` from `tasks/forms.py`), which captures the `name` and `description`. The `project_create` view (in `tasks/views.py`) handles form submission, automatically associating the new project with the logged-in `request.user`.
*   **Tasks**: Within a project, users can add tasks using the `TaskForm` (from `tasks/forms.py`). This form collects the `description`, initial `status`, and an optional `due_date`. The `task_create` view (in `tasks/views.py`), which is accessed via a project-specific URL, handles task creation and links it to the correct project.

**2. AI-Assisted Creation:**

A significant feature is the ability to create projects and tasks using natural language instructions through the `ai_command_handler` view (in `tasks/views.py`). This view processes user input by leveraging the Google Gemini AI model.

*   **Process**:
    1.  User provides an instruction (e.g., "Create a project for my new website" or "Add a task to 'Website Project' to design the homepage by next Friday").
    2.  The `ai_command_handler` sends this instruction, along with contextual information (like current date and existing user categories for disambiguation if needed), to the Gemini model.
    3.  The AI model is configured with specific function declarations (`GEMINI_FUNCTION_DECLARATIONS` in `tasks/views.py`) that allow it to understand the intent to create a project or task. These declarations include:
        *   `create_project`: Expects parameters like `name` and `description`.
        *   `create_task`: Expects parameters like `project_name`, `description`, `status`, and `due_date`.
    4.  If the AI identifies an intent to create, it returns a function call request with the extracted parameters.
    5.  The backend then uses dedicated service functions (e.g., `create_project_for_user`, `create_task_for_project` from `tasks/services.py`) to create the actual database entries.
    6.  The `original_instruction` field in both `Project` and `Task` models is populated with the user's raw text input for traceability.

This AI integration simplifies the creation process, allowing users to quickly populate their task lists without navigating multiple forms.

#### Status Tracking

Task progress is managed via the `status` attribute in the `Task` model.

*   The available statuses are 'todo', 'doing', and 'done'.
*   Tasks are created with a default status of 'todo'.
*   The `Task` model includes helper methods:
    *   `mark_as_completed()`: Changes the task's status to 'done' and sets the `completed_at` timestamp to the current time.
    *   `mark_as_todo()`: Can be used to revert a 'done' task back to 'todo', clearing the `completed_at` timestamp.

These statuses and methods allow for clear tracking of task completion.

#### User Association and Access Control

*   Each `Project` is directly linked to a `User` via a `ForeignKey`.
*   `Task` entities are associated with a `Project`. Therefore, a task belongs to the user who owns the project.
*   Views responsible for displaying projects and tasks, such as `project_list` and `project_detail` (defined in `tasks/views.py`), ensure that users can only see and interact with their own data by filtering querysets based on `request.user`.

#### Relevant Views and Forms

*   **Views (`tasks/views.py`)**:
    *   `project_list`: Displays all projects belonging to the logged-in user.
    *   `project_detail`: Shows the details of a specific project and lists its associated tasks.
    *   `project_create`: Handles the manual creation of new projects.
    *   `task_create`: Handles the manual creation of new tasks within a project.
    *   `ai_command_handler`: Processes natural language commands for AI-assisted creation.
*   **Forms (`tasks/forms.py`)**:
    *   `ProjectForm`: Used for manual project creation, capturing `name` and `description`.
    *   `TaskForm`: Used for manual task creation, capturing `description`, `status`, and `due_date`.

These components work together to provide a comprehensive task management experience within the `tasks` application.

### Expense Tracking (`accounting` app)

The `accounting` application is designed to help users manage their financial transactions, primarily focusing on expense tracking. It allows for categorization of expenses, association with projects, and leverages AI to streamline the process of recording expenditures.

#### Core Data Models

The expense tracking system is built upon two key models defined in `accounting/models.py`:

1.  **`Category`**: Represents a user-defined category for classifying transactions.
    *   **Key Attributes**:
        *   `name` (CharField): The name of the category (e.g., "Food", "Transport", "Software").
        *   `user` (ForeignKey to `User`): Links the category to a specific user. Category names are unique per user, as enforced by `unique_together = ('name', 'user')`.

2.  **`Transaction`**: Represents an individual financial transaction, typically an expense.
    *   **Key Attributes**:
        *   `description` (CharField): A description of the transaction (e.g., "Lunch with client", "Monthly software subscription").
        *   `amount` (DecimalField): The monetary value of the transaction.
        *   `transaction_date` (DateField): The date on which the transaction occurred. Defaults to the current date.
        *   `type` (CharField): The type of transaction, with 'expense' as the current default and primary focus.
        *   `category` (ForeignKey to `Category`): Links the transaction to one of the user's predefined categories. This is optional.
        *   `project` (ForeignKey to `tasks.Project`): Optionally links the transaction to a project defined in the `tasks` application, enabling project-based cost tracking.
        *   `user` (ForeignKey to `User`): Links the transaction directly to the user who recorded it.
        *   `notes` (TextField): Optional field for any additional notes.
        *   `original_instruction` (TextField): Stores the original user instruction if the transaction data was initially extracted via an AI command, offering context for the entry.
        *   `created_at` (DateTimeField): Timestamp for when the transaction was recorded (auto-generated).
        *   `updated_at` (DateTimeField): Timestamp for the last update (auto-generated).

#### Expense and Category Management

**1. Category Management:**

*   Categories are specific to each user. Users can define their own set of categories to organize their expenses.
*   The `TransactionForm` (in `accounting/forms.py`), used for manual transaction entry, dynamically populates its category selection field with categories belonging to the currently logged-in user.
*   While detailed views for category CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) are not explicitly covered here, the system infrastructure supports user-owned categories (e.g., through Django admin or future dedicated views). The AI-assisted expense creation also includes functionality to create new categories on the fly if specified by the user.

**2. Manual Transaction Creation:**

*   Users can manually record new expenses using the `TransactionForm`. This form allows input for `description`, `amount`, `transaction_date`, `type` (defaulted to 'expense'), `category` (chosen from the user's list), associated `project` (chosen from the user's projects), and `notes`.
*   The `transaction_create` view (in `accounting/views.py`) handles the submission of this form. It automatically assigns the transaction to the logged-in `request.user`.

**3. AI-Assisted Expense Data Extraction & Confirmation:**

A key feature is the system's ability to process natural language instructions to extract expense information, facilitating quicker recording. This is primarily handled by the `ai_command_handler` view (located in `tasks/views.py` due to its shared nature).

*   **Information Extraction Process**:
    1.  User provides a natural language instruction (e.g., "Spent $25 on lunch yesterday for the marketing project" or "Record a $150 software purchase for 'Alpha Project' for today, categorize as 'Software'").
    2.  The `ai_command_handler` sends this instruction to the Google Gemini AI model. To improve accuracy, the instruction is augmented with context, including the current date and a list of the user's existing expense categories (fetched from `Category.objects.filter(user=request.user)`).
    3.  The AI is configured with an `extract_expense_data` function declaration. This function aims to identify and return:
        *   `description`: What the expense was for.
        *   `amount`: The monetary value.
        *   `transaction_date`: The date of the expense (resolving relative dates like "yesterday" based on the provided current date).
        *   `category_name_guess`: A suggestion for an existing category.
        *   `project_name_guess`: A suggestion for an existing project.
    4.  The AI's response, containing these extracted fields, is sent back to the `ai_command_handler`.

*   **User Confirmation Step**:
    1.  The backend does not immediately create the transaction. Instead, it returns a JSON response to the frontend with `action_needed: "confirm_expense"`.
    2.  This response includes the `extracted_data` from the AI and a list of the user's `user_categories` (ID and name).
    3.  The frontend then presents these details to the user, allowing them to:
        *   Verify and correct any AI-extracted information (description, amount, date).
        *   Select an existing category from their list.
        *   Type in a name for a new category if the desired one doesn't exist.
        *   Confirm or select the associated project.

*   **Transaction Creation (Post-Confirmation)**:
    1.  Once the user confirms (and potentially modifies) the details on the frontend, the data is sent back to the `ai_command_handler` (under the `action == 'confirm_creation'` block).
    2.  This data now includes `selected_category_id` (if an existing category was chosen) or `create_category_with_name` (if a new one was specified by the user), along with other expense details.
    3.  The `create_transaction_from_data` service function (in `accounting/services.py`) is then invoked. This service:
        *   Parses and validates the `description`, `amount`, and `transaction_date`.
        *   If `selected_category_id` is provided, it fetches the corresponding `Category` object.
        *   If `create_category_with_name` is provided, it uses `Category.objects.get_or_create()` (with a case-insensitive lookup on `name` for the given `user`) to either find an existing category or create a new one.
        *   If a `project_name` is provided, it attempts to find the user's project (case-insensitive).
        *   Finally, it creates and saves the `Transaction` object, storing the `original_instruction` (the initial natural language query) for reference.

#### User and Project Association

*   **User Ownership**: Both `Category` and `Transaction` models have a direct `ForeignKey` to the `User` model. This ensures that users can only access and manage their own financial data. Views like `transaction_list` filter records by `request.user`. The `TransactionFilterForm` used in this list view also correctly populates its category dropdown with only the user's categories.
*   **Project Linking**: Transactions can be optionally linked to projects from the `tasks` app via the `project` ForeignKey on the `Transaction` model. This allows for financial tracking within the context of specific projects, providing a more granular view of project-related expenditures. The `TransactionForm` and the AI-assisted flow both support associating expenses with user-owned projects.

#### Relevant Views and Forms

*   **Views**:
    *   `accounting/views.py`:
        *   `transaction_list`: Displays a paginated list of the logged-in user's expenses. It incorporates the `TransactionFilterForm` to allow filtering by category.
        *   `transaction_create`: Handles the form for manually creating new expense transactions.
    *   `tasks/views.py`:
        *   `ai_command_handler`: Manages the interaction with the AI for extracting expense data from natural language, and subsequently handles the confirmed data to create transactions using the `accounting.services.create_transaction_from_data` service.
*   **Forms (`accounting/forms.py`)**:
    *   `TransactionForm`: Used for manual creation and editing of transactions. It dynamically populates choice fields (like category and project) based on the user's data.
    *   `TransactionFilterForm`: Used in the `transaction_list` view to enable filtering of transactions, primarily by category. Its category field is also populated with user-specific categories.

These components collectively provide a comprehensive system for tracking expenses, with both manual and AI-assisted input methods, ensuring data is correctly associated with users and optionally with their projects.

### Dashboard (`dashboard` app)

The `dashboard` application serves as the central landing page for users upon logging into the TaskFlow system. Its primary purpose is to provide a consolidated overview of their ongoing activities and recent financial transactions, drawing data from the `tasks` and `accounting` applications.

#### Overview and Structure

Unlike the `tasks` and `accounting` apps, the `dashboard` app does not introduce its own database models. Instead, it functions as a presentation layer, querying and displaying existing data in a summarized format. This provides users with a quick snapshot of their current workload and spending without needing to navigate to each specific section.

#### Core Functionality: `dashboard_view`

The main logic for the dashboard is encapsulated in the `dashboard_view`, located in `dashboard/views.py`. This view is protected by the `@login_required` decorator, ensuring that only authenticated users can access their dashboard.

The `dashboard_view` is responsible for fetching and preparing the data to be displayed:

1.  **Data Fetching (for the logged-in `request.user`):**
    *   **Projects and Tasks Summary (from `tasks` app):**
        *   It retrieves all `Project` objects associated with the current user: `Project.objects.filter(user=request.user)`.
        *   To optimize the loading of tasks related to these projects, it uses `.prefetch_related('task_set')`. This allows the template to efficiently access tasks for each project (e.g., to display task counts, summaries of task statuses like 'todo', 'doing', 'done', or upcoming due dates).
        *   Projects are typically ordered by name: `.order_by('name')`.
        *   The entire list of user's projects (with their prefetched tasks) is passed to the template. The template (`dashboard/dashboard.html`) can then iterate through these projects and display relevant task information as needed.

    *   **Recent Expenses Summary (from `accounting` app):**
        *   It fetches the five most recent expense transactions for the user: `Transaction.objects.filter(user=request.user, type='expense')`.
        *   To efficiently include details of the category and any associated project for each transaction, `.select_related('category', 'project')` is used.
        *   Transactions are ordered by `transaction_date` (descending) and then by `created_at` (descending) to show the latest ones first: `.order_by('-transaction_date', '-created_at')[:5]`.

2.  **Context Preparation and Rendering:**
    *   The fetched data, specifically the list of `projects` (with their tasks) and `recent_transactions`, is compiled into a context dictionary.
    *   This context is then passed to the `dashboard/dashboard.html` template. The template is responsible for the visual presentation of this information, arranging it into a user-friendly overview that might include project lists, task summaries per project, and a list of recent expenses.

The `dashboard` app thus provides a vital role in enhancing user experience by offering a quick and accessible summary of their most pertinent information within the TaskFlow system. Future enhancements to the `dashboard_view` could include more sophisticated aggregations, such as counts of overdue tasks, upcoming deadlines, or spending summaries by category directly in the view logic.

## Django Framework Usage

The TaskFlow system is developed using Django, a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Django's robust features and architecture provide a solid foundation for building this task and expense management application.

### Model-View-Template (MVT) Architecture

Django follows the Model-View-Template (MVT) architectural pattern, which is a variation of the more commonly known Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern. This separation of concerns is evident in the project's structure:

*   **Models**: Defined primarily in `models.py` files within each application (`tasks`, `accounting`). Models represent the data structure of the application and interact with the database. Django's Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) is utilized to define these models as Python classes, abstracting direct SQL interaction and facilitating database operations like creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting records.
*   **Views**: Located in `views.py` files within each app, views are request handlers that process incoming HTTP requests, implement business logic, interact with models to fetch or save data, and then select an appropriate template to render the response. For example, `tasks.views.project_list` fetches projects for a user and passes them to a template for display.
*   **Templates**: These are typically HTML files (e.g., `dashboard/dashboard.html`, `tasks/project_list.html`) that define the presentation layer of the application. Django's templating system is used to dynamically generate HTML content by embedding data passed from the views (the "context") into the template structure. This allows for reusable page layouts and components.

### Project Organization into Apps

Django promotes organizing projects into self-contained "apps," each handling a distinct piece of functionality. This modular approach enhances code organization and reusability. The TaskFlow project is structured with the following key applications:

*   **`tasks`**: Manages all aspects of project and task creation, tracking, and modification, including both manual and AI-assisted methods.
*   **`accounting`**: Handles financial aspects, including expense categorization, transaction recording (manual and AI-assisted), and linking expenses to projects.
*   **`dashboard`**: Provides a consolidated overview and summary of data from the `tasks` and `accounting` apps, serving as the main landing page for users.
*   **User Management (via `django.contrib.auth`)**: While not a custom app in this project's file structure, Django's built-in `django.contrib.auth` application is heavily utilized for user authentication (login, logout, password management) and authorization (controlling access to views and data).

### Key Django Features Utilized

Beyond the MVT architecture and app structure, several core Django features are integral to the TaskFlow system:

*   **Object-Relational Mapper (ORM)**: As mentioned, Django's ORM simplifies database interactions. Model classes like `Project`, `Task`, `Category`, and `Transaction` are mapped to database tables, and database queries are performed using Python code, enhancing developer productivity and database portability.
*   **Templating System**: Django's template language allows for the creation of dynamic web pages by embedding variables, tags, and filters within HTML files. This is used extensively across all apps to render user interfaces. Features like template inheritance (e.g., using a `base.html`) help maintain a consistent look and feel.
*   **User Authentication and Authorization**: The project leverages `django.contrib.auth` for robust user management. This includes:
    *   Handling user registration (implicitly, if using Django's default mechanisms or a simple form).
    *   User login and logout functionality.
    *   Protecting views and resources using the `@login_required` decorator, ensuring that only authenticated users can access specific parts of the application (e.g., dashboards, project details).
    *   Associating data (projects, tasks, expenses) with specific users through `ForeignKey` relationships to the `User` model.
*   **URL Routing**: Django's URL dispatcher (configured in `urls.py` files at both project and app levels) maps browser URLs to specific view functions, enabling clean and organized navigation within the application.
*   **Forms Framework**: Django's forms library (e.g., `ProjectForm`, `TaskForm`, `TransactionForm` in `forms.py` files) simplifies the creation, validation, and processing of HTML forms, which are used for manual data entry.
*   **Admin Panel**: Django provides a built-in administrative interface (`django.contrib.admin`) which is likely configured for this project (as seen by `admin.py` files in the apps). This powerful tool allows administrators to manage application data (users, projects, tasks, etc.) with minimal effort, useful for development, debugging, and administrative tasks.

By leveraging these features, Django provides a comprehensive and efficient framework for building the TaskFlow application, allowing developers to focus on application-specific logic while relying on Django for common web development patterns and tasks.

## AI Integration with Google Gemini

A core innovation in the TaskFlow system is its integration with Artificial Intelligence, specifically leveraging the Google Gemini API. This allows users to interact with the system using natural language to create projects, tasks, and initiate expense recording, significantly streamlining these common operations.

### Central AI Processing: `ai_command_handler`

The primary interface with the Gemini API is managed within the `ai_command_handler` view, located in `tasks/views.py`. This view, accessible only to authenticated users via a POST request, orchestrates the process of understanding user instructions and translating them into system actions.

The process is as follows:

1.  **Instruction Reception**: The view receives the user's natural language instruction (e.g., "create a new project called 'Summer Vacation Planning'" or "log a $50 expense for 'team lunch' for today's date, category food") from the frontend.
2.  **API Key Configuration**: It retrieves the `GOOGLE_API_KEY` from environment variables and configures the `genai` (Google Generative AI) client.
3.  **Contextualization for Gemini**: Before sending the instruction to Gemini, the system may enrich it with relevant context. For instance, when processing potential expenses, the current server date and a list of the user's existing expense categories are prepended to the user's instruction. This helps Gemini provide more accurate date parsing and category suggestions.
4.  **Model Initialization**: A `GenerativeModel` instance is initialized, typically using `gemini-1.5-flash-latest`. Crucially, this model is configured with `tools` (the `GEMINI_FUNCTION_DECLARATIONS`) and `safety_settings`.

### Function Calling Mechanism

The TaskFlow system utilizes Gemini's powerful function calling capability to translate natural language into specific, actionable operations.

*   **`GEMINI_FUNCTION_DECLARATIONS`**: This is a list of dictionaries defined in `tasks/views.py`, where each dictionary describes a function that the AI can "request" to be called. Each declaration specifies:
    *   `name`: The name of the function (e.g., `create_project`, `create_task`, `extract_expense_data`).
    *   `description`: A natural language description of what the function does, helping the AI understand when to use it.
    *   `parameters`: A JSON schema defining the arguments the function expects (e.g., for `create_project`, parameters include `name` and an optional `description`; for `extract_expense_data`, parameters include `description`, `amount`, `transaction_date`, `category_name_guess`, and `project_name_guess`).
    *   `required`: A list of parameter names that are mandatory for the function call.

*   **AI Processing and Response**: When Gemini receives the user's instruction and the function declarations, it analyzes the text. If the instruction aligns with one of the declared functions, Gemini doesn't just respond with text; instead, it can return a structured JSON object indicating the specific function it believes should be called and the arguments it has extracted from the user's query.

### Processing AI's Response in `ai_command_handler`

The `ai_command_handler` then inspects Gemini's response:

1.  **Function Call Identified**:
    *   If the response contains a `function_call` part, the handler extracts the `function_name` and its `args` (arguments).
    *   Based on the `function_name`:
        *   **`create_project`**: The system uses the extracted `name` and `description` to call the `tasks.services.create_project_for_user` service, which creates a new project. The user's original raw instruction is saved in the `Project.original_instruction` field.
        *   **`create_task`**: The extracted `project_name`, `description`, `status`, and `due_date` are used. The system first fetches the relevant project using `tasks.services.get_project_by_user_and_name` and then calls `tasks.services.create_task_for_project`. The `Task.original_instruction` field is populated.
        *   **`extract_expense_data`**: This triggers a two-step process.
            1.  The AI extracts details like `description`, `amount`, `transaction_date`, `category_name_guess`, and `project_name_guess`.
            2.  Instead of direct creation, the handler returns a JSON response to the frontend (`action_needed: "confirm_expense"`) containing this `extracted_data` and a list of the user's existing expense categories.
            3.  The user then reviews, potentially modifies (e.g., selects an exact category, corrects the amount), and confirms these details on the frontend.
            4.  This confirmed data is sent back to `ai_command_handler` (under a different `action` flag: `confirm_creation`). The `accounting.services.create_transaction_from_data` service is then called to finally record the transaction, which also saves the `Transaction.original_instruction`.
    *   A JSON response is sent to the frontend indicating success (with created entity ID) or failure.

2.  **Plain Text Response**: If Gemini returns a simple text response (no function call detected), this text is relayed back to the user, which might occur if the instruction is ambiguous or doesn't map to a defined function.

### Safety Settings and Error Handling

The integration includes considerations for safe and robust operation:

*   **Safety Settings**: The `GenerativeModel` is initialized with `safety_settings`. In the provided code, these are configured with `HarmBlockThreshold.BLOCK_NONE` for categories like `HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT`, `HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH`, etc. This implies a more permissive content policy from the AI, which might be suitable for an internal tool where user inputs are generally expected to be benign and work-related. However, for broader applications, these settings would typically be more restrictive.
*   **Error Handling**: The `ai_command_handler` incorporates several layers of error handling:
    *   Checks for the `GOOGLE_API_KEY`.
    *   Handles `json.JSONDecodeError` if the request body is malformed.
    *   Validates necessary data from the AI's response (e.g., presence of `name` for project creation).
    *   Catches `StopCandidateException` from the Gemini API, which can occur for various reasons (e.g., `MALFORMED_FUNCTION_CALL` if the AI struggles to structure the function, or if content is blocked due to `SAFETY` or `RECITATION`). Specific user-friendly messages are returned based on the `finish_reason`.
    *   A general `Exception` catch-all logs critical errors and returns a generic server error message, preventing raw tracebacks from reaching the user.

This AI integration with Google Gemini, particularly its function calling feature, allows TaskFlow to offer a more intuitive and efficient user experience by understanding and acting upon natural language commands.

## Database Design and Management

The database serves as the persistent storage layer for all data within the TaskFlow application, including user information, projects, tasks, expense categories, and financial transactions. Django's powerful Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) is utilized for all interactions with the database, providing an abstraction layer over direct SQL.

### Core Data Models

The application's data is organized into several key models, defined within their respective apps:

**1. `tasks.models`:**

*   **`Project`**: Represents a user-defined project or a container for tasks.
    *   Key attributes: `name` (CharField), `description` (TextField, optional), `user` (ForeignKey to `User`), `created_at` (DateTimeField, auto-added), `original_instruction` (TextField, for AI-created projects).
*   **`Task`**: Represents an individual task or to-do item within a `Project`.
    *   Key attributes: `description` (TextField), `status` (CharField with choices: 'todo', 'doing', 'done'), `project` (ForeignKey to `Project`), `created_at` (DateTimeField, auto-added), `due_date` (DateField, optional), `completed_at` (DateTimeField, optional), `original_instruction` (TextField, for AI-created tasks).

**2. `accounting.models`:**

*   **`Category`**: Defines user-specific categories for organizing expenses.
    *   Key attributes: `name` (CharField), `user` (ForeignKey to `User`). Importantly, `Meta.unique_together = ('name', 'user')` ensures that category names are unique per user.
*   **`Transaction`**: Records individual financial transactions, primarily expenses.
    *   Key attributes: `description` (CharField), `amount` (DecimalField), `transaction_date` (DateField), `type` (CharField, default 'expense'), `category` (ForeignKey to `Category`, nullable), `project` (ForeignKey to `tasks.Project`, nullable), `user` (ForeignKey to `User`), `notes` (TextField, optional), `original_instruction` (TextField, for AI-processed expenses), `created_at` (DateTimeField, auto-added), `updated_at` (DateTimeField, auto-updated).

### Key Relationships

These models are interconnected through various relationships, primarily using Django's `ForeignKey` field:

*   **User Ownership**: All primary data entities (`Project`, `Category`, `Transaction`) are directly linked to the `User` model (from `django.contrib.auth.models`). `Task` models are indirectly linked to a `User` via their parent `Project`. This ensures data isolation and user-specific views.
*   **Project-Task Relationship**: A one-to-many relationship exists between `Project` and `Task`. A single project can have multiple tasks. The `on_delete=models.CASCADE` setting on `Task.project` ensures that if a project is deleted, all its associated tasks are also deleted.
*   **Transaction-Category Relationship**: A many-to-one relationship exists where a `Transaction` can belong to one `Category`. If a `Category` is deleted, the `category` field in related `Transaction` instances is set to `NULL` due to `on_delete=models.SET_NULL`.
*   **Transaction-Project Relationship**: A `Transaction` can optionally be associated with a `Project`. This is also a many-to-one relationship with `on_delete=models.SET_NULL`, allowing transactions to remain even if the linked project is removed.

### Django Object-Relational Mapper (ORM)

All interactions with the underlying database (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL) are managed through Django's ORM.
*   **Model-to-Table Mapping**: Each model class (e.g., `Project`, `Task`) is mapped by the ORM to a corresponding table in the database. Fields in the model become columns in the table.
*   **Pythonic Database Operations**: Instead of writing raw SQL queries, database operations are performed using Python code. For example:
    *   Creating a new project: `Project.objects.create(name="New Project", user=request.user)`
    *   Querying tasks: `Task.objects.filter(project=my_project, status='todo')`
    *   Updating a task: `task.status = 'done'; task.save()`
*   **Benefits**:
    *   **Abstraction**: Hides the complexity of database-specific SQL syntax.
    *   **Productivity**: Speeds up development by allowing developers to work with Python objects.
    *   **Security**: Helps prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities by automatically escaping query parameters.
    *   **Portability**: Makes it easier to switch between different database systems with minimal code changes.

### Database Migrations

Django's migration system is used to manage and apply changes to the database schema as the application's models evolve over time.
*   **`migrations` Directory**: Each app (`tasks`, `accounting`) contains a `migrations` directory that stores migration files. These files are Python scripts that describe the changes to be made to the database schema (e.g., creating a table, adding a column, altering a field).
*   **Generating Migrations**: When changes are made to `models.py` (e.g., adding a new field or model), the `python manage.py makemigrations <app_name>` command is run. Django detects these changes and generates a new migration file.
*   **Applying Migrations**: The `python manage.py migrate` command applies any pending migrations to the database, updating the schema to match the current model definitions.
*   **Benefits**:
    *   **Version Control for Schema**: Database schema changes are tracked in version control alongside the codebase.
    *   **Reliable Updates**: Ensures that schema changes are applied consistently across different development, testing, and production environments.
    *   **Schema Evolution**: Facilitates the evolution of the database schema as application requirements change.

This structured approach to database design and management, powered by Django's ORM and migration system, provides a robust and maintainable foundation for the TaskFlow application.
